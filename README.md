# Project: Deep-Learning-P1

Note the code for this porgam is runing through google colab. if you want to run the code. please mount with you personal google drive at "connect google drive" cell. Also, modify your own saving path at "Saving model" cell and "Load saving model" cell. 

The below text are the title for the code. if you want to find any part of code in notebook. you can copy the title and use control F to find the code cell in notebook.


###Pre-setting for google colab
